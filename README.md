# hello-world
initial github repository tutorial

Hello all - fairly new to coding and web development. Currently working as a structural engineer in Los Angeles. Also currently taking a part-time intro to front-end development course. Hoping to make a career switch into the field after a more immersive bootcamp in the next few months. We shall see!
